1. AN ADMONITION TO THE NOBLE, ANCIENT, VICTORIOVS, VALIANT, AND MOST BRAVE NATION OF ENGLISHMEN.

    _ There are foure eſpeciall markes to know the Italian fight is imperfect & that the Italian teachers and ſetters forth of books of Defence, neuer had the perfection of the true fight.

    _ Of ſixe chiefe cauſes, that many valiant men thinking themſelues by their practiſes to be skilfull in their weapons, are yet manie times in their fight ſore hurt, and manie times ſlaine by men of ſmall skill, or none at all.

    _ What is the cauſe that wiſemen in learning or practiſing their weapons, are deceiued with Italian Fencers.

    _ Of the falſe reſolutions and vaine opinions of Rapier-men, and of the danger of death thereby enſuing.

    _ That the cauſe that manie are ſo often ſlaine, and manie ſore hurt in fight with long Rapiers, is not by reaſon of their dangerous thruſts, nor cunningneſſe of that Italienated fight, but in the length and vnweildineſſe thereof.

    _ Of running and ſtanding faſt in Rapier fight, the runner hath the vantage.

    _ Of ſtriking and thruſting both together.

    _ George Siluer his reſolution vpon that hidden or doubtfull queſtion, who hath the aduantage of the Offender or Defender.

    _ Of Spanish fight vvith the Rapier.

    _ Illuſions for the maintenance of imperfect weapons & falſe fights, to feare or diſcourage the vnskilfull in their weapons, from taking a true courſe or vſe, for attaining to the perfect knowledge of true fight.

    _ That a blow commeth continually as neare a way as a thruſt, and moſt commonly nearer, ſtronger, more ſwifter, and is ſooner done.

    _ Perfect fight ſtandeth vpon both blow and thruſt, therefore the thruſt is not onely to be vſed.

    _ That the blow is more dangerous and deadly in fight, then a thruſt, for proofe thereof to be made according with Art, an Englishman holdeth argument againſt an Italian.

    _ Of the difference betwixt the true fight & the falſe: wherin conſiſteth (the Principles being had with the direction of the foure Gouernors) the whole perfection of fight with all maner of weapons.

    _ Of euill orders or customes in our English Fēce-ſchooles, & of the old or ancient teaching of weapons, & things very neceſſarie to be continued for the auoiding of errors, and reuining and continuance of our ancient vveapons, and moſt victorious fight againe.

    _ The grounds or Principles of true fight with all maner of weapons.

    _ The wardes of all maner of weapons.

    _ The names and numbers of times appertaining vnto fight both true and falſe.

    _ The falſe times be theſe.

    _ Of the length of weapons, and how euerie man may fit himſelfe in the perfect length of his weapon, according to his owne ſtature, with briefe reaſons wherefore they ought to be ſo.

    _ Of the lengths of the Battel axe, Halbard, or blacke Bill, or ſuch like vveapons of weight, appertaining vnto gard or battell.

    _ Of the vantages of weapons in their kinds, places, & times, both in priuate and publike fight.

    _ Of the inſufficiencie and diſaduantages of the Rapiers fight in Battell.

    _ Of the vantages and ſufficiencie of the short Sword fight in battell.

    _ That all maner of double weapons, or weapons to be vſed with both handes, haue aduantage againſt the ſingle Rapier or ſingle Sword, there is no queſtion to be made. That the Sword and Buckler hath the vantage againſt the Sword and Dagger.

    _ That the Sword and Buckler hath the vantage against the Sword and Target.

    _ The short Staffe.

    _ The short Staffe hath the vantage against the long ſtaffe, and Morris Pike, and the Forreſt bill againſt all maner of weapons.

    _ Againe of the vantages of weapons.

    _ Againe for the short Staffe or halfe Pike.

    _ Queſtions and anſwers betweene the Scholler and the Maiſter, of the vantages and diſaduantages betweene a tall man, and a man of meane ſtature, hauing both the perfect knowledge in their weapons.

    _ Of the long ſingle Rapier fight betweene valiant men, hauing both skill, he that it the beſt wraſtler, or if neither of them can wraſtle, the ſtrongeſt man moſt commonly killeth the other, or leaueth him at his mercie.

    _ Of the Rapier and Poiniard fight betwixt valiant men, hauing both skill.

    _ Of the long Rapier & Poiniard-fight betweene two valiant men, the one hauing skil, the other none: that he that hath no skill hath the vantage.

    _ Of the long ſingle Rapier, or Rapier and Poiniard-fight betweene two vnskilfull men being valiant.

    _ Of the imperfection and inſufficiencie of Rapiers in generall, of what length ſoeuer they be.

    _ Of the imperfection and inſufficiencie of the fight of the ſingle Rapier, Rapier and Poiniard, Rapier and Buckler, Rapier and Cloke, and Rapier and Gloue of maile.

    _ That the reaſons vſed by the Italian Fencers in commending the vſe of the Rapier and Poiniard, becauſe it maketh peace, maketh againſt themſelues.

    _ That the short Sword hath the aduantage againſt the long Sword or long Rapier.

    _ George Siluer his militarie riddle, truly ſet downe betweene the Perfection and Imperfection of fight: containing the handling of the foure fights: wherein true conſiſteth the whole ſumme and full perfection of the true fight, with all maner of weapons, with an inuicible concluſion.
